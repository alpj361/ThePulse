The previous AI engineer was tasked with transforming the Vizta UI chatbot into a more user-friendly, Perplexity-like interface with smooth loading components, focusing on existing features and keeping the chat in a sidebar. Initially, the AI identified the core UI component as  and proposed a comprehensive plan for enhancements, including skeleton loaders, streaming text, tabbed message display, and visual polish.

Challenges arose during environment setup, including a missing  and an incorrect assumption about the project's frontend/backend structure (it was a root-level Vite project, not split into  and ). This led to supervisor errors and a blank screen due to missing Supabase environment variables, which the AI resolved by creating a mock  file.

Following initial UI enhancements, the user requested a more formal, journalistic aesthetic, conditional display of sources, and specific color/logo choices. The AI generated a detailed plan incorporating these refinements and applied numerous edits to  and supporting components. The most recent task involved adding a context button to the chat interface, with the UI implemented but functionality pending. The AI successfully added the button's structure and refined its placement.

The user initially requested to make the Vizta UI chatbot more user-friendly, similar to Perplexity's interface, with smooth loading components and a sidebar chat. This entailed enhancing the existing UI without changing core functionality. The AI proposed, and the user approved, a plan focusing on smooth loading (skeleton loaders, streaming text, typing indicators), enhanced message display (tabbed interface for Answer/Sources/Steps, better Markdown, copy buttons), visual polish (smoother gradients, micro-interactions, improved typography), and interactive elements (source citations, follow-up suggestions).

Subsequently, the user requested a more formal, journalistic aesthetic, stating the app should not look like traditional newspapers but a modern journalistic app. Specific feedback included making it less decorated, having a more formal logo, conditionally showing sources only when available, and keeping quick prompts with their existing colors. The user chose a minimal badge design logo (Option B) and News Blue color palette (Option A). The latest request was to add a context button to the chat interface, specifying its placement within the input area, appearance as a dropdown with an expandable modal, content (text/documents, information, projects, activities), and an appropriate icon. The functionality for this button is not yet required.

<code_architecture>
The application has a root-level Vite React frontend. Although initial environment setup mentioned backend/frontend directories, the actual structure found by the AI indicates a unified frontend at the root.



-   : **Created** by AI. This file was initially missing, causing the app to fail due to missing . The AI created it with mock  and  to enable the frontend to load for UI development.
-   : This is the **most significant file modified**.
    -   **Importance**: Contains the main Vizta Chat UI, including message display, input area, loading states, and quick prompts.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initially, an enhanced version () was created, and then its content replaced the original .
        -   Extensive UI modifications for Perplexity-like features: smooth loading animations, streaming text, typing indicators, tabbed interface (Answer/Sources/Steps).
        -   Refinements for a journalistic look: color palette adjustments, logo integration (minimal badge style), UI simplification (reduced gradients, subtle animations), conditional rendering of tabs based on data availability, typography updates, and button/input styling changes.
        -   Welcome screen and quick prompts were updated for a more professional look.
        -   Old input styling and duplicate code were removed.
        -   **Most recently, the structure for a context button (dropdown menu with modal) was added to the input area.**
-   : **Created** by AI. This component provides the animated typing dots for the AI response.
-   : **Created** by AI. This component provides animated content placeholders for smooth loading.
-   : **Created** by AI. This component enables character-by-character text display for AI responses.
-   : **Created** by AI. This component adds a one-click copy functionality, likely for code blocks or message responses.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement the functionality and content for the newly added context button. Currently, only its UI structure (dropdown and modal) has been created.
-   Conduct a full visual review of the updated UI to ensure it fully aligns with the modern journalistic app aesthetic.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing the user's latest request: adding a context button to the chat interface. The user provided explicit details for this, including its placement (within the input area, next to it), its interactive behavior (a dropdown menu that can expand to show a central modal), its content (text/documents, information, projects, and user activities on the platform), and the icon (context/information icon).

The AI successfully implemented the UI structure for this context button by modifying . It also adjusted the spacing around the input area to accommodate the new button. The server was restarted, and the AI was in the process of taking screenshots to demonstrate these changes before generating the summary. The functionality and actual content for the context button are explicitly stated as not yet implemented.
